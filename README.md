# Coding Practice Journey README

## Introduction

Hello everyone! üëã I am Shivam, and I am excited to embark on a new coding practice journey! I have decided to challenge myself by solving at least one Competitive Programming (CP) question every day for the next three months.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this journey is to enhance my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency. By consistently engaging with CP questions, I aim to strengthen my foundation in data structures and algorithms.

## Commitment

I am committed to daily practice and improvement. To keep track of my progress, I will maintain a daily log in an Excel spreadsheet (xlsx file). This log will document the questions attempted, the solutions implemented, and any additional notes or insights gained during the process.

## Repository Structure

The repository will be organized as follows:

- **Code:** This directory will contain my solutions to the daily CP questions. Each file will be appropriately named to reflect the problem statement or its key aspects.

- **Excel Log:** The Excel spreadsheet, named `CodingPracticeLog.xlsx`, will be regularly updated to include details about the questions attempted, date, time spent, and any learnings or observations.

## Daily Routine

1. **Solving Questions:** I will select a CP question daily from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces. The focus will be on a diverse range of topics and difficulty levels.

2. **Committing to GitHub:** After successfully solving a problem, I will commit the solution code to this GitHub repository. The commit message will include a brief summary of the problem.

3. **Updating Excel Log:** Concurrently, I will update the `CodingPracticeLog.xlsx` file with relevant information for that day's practice.
